# Repository for scraping from canva.com to automate certificate making process.

The primary python library used is Selenium.
As the script is internet dependent, slow internet sometimes can cause the script go nuts sometimes.
So when connection issue occurs, it is better to stop the script and run it again.
`position.txt` keeps track of the index in the csv where the the script was terminated.
When running a new csv, change position.txt value to 0.

Enjoy!!!
